# FindMe_Application

This application is for my groups capstone project, creating a anti-loss device that can attach to a persons personal belongings
and will perform different functionalities, such as an alarm, buzzer and light flashing when the device is out of range. The
device will be connected to a users phone and will alert them if the device is out of range, can be connected via bluetooth
and the user has the ability to track the device via GPS and can sound the alarm, buzzer or flashing light from the application.
